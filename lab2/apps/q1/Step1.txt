1. How many semaphores are available in DLXOS?
32 as indicated by MAX_SEMS
2. How many locks are available in DLXOS?
64 as indicated by MAX_LOCKS
3. How is a semaphore created in DLXOS?
First we check if synchronization has failed, then we check
if the queue is successfully prepared, and then we initialize
the semaphore with an integer value.
4. Explain how sem_signal and sem_wait work.
sem_signal: increment the counter before checking the value in the semaphore, and if the value is larger than 0,
            that means there is a process to wake up and we put it in the pcb queue
sem_wait: wait until the value is less than or equal to zero and then start the process.
5. What is a handle and how is it used to access semaphores in DLXOS?
Handle is our access to the semaphores. First it checks if sem work, if it exceeds the maximum number of
semaphores, and check if the requested semaphore is inuse at all. If all those checks do not fail, we run the signal.
