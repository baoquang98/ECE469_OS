You can run this program to test your priority queues.  This program in no way comes
close to testing everything.  You are free to modify this however you wish.

One simple test that you can run with this program is:

$ make run > log
$ diff log expected_output

The expected_output file is what was printed by the solution code.  Your code should
switch processes in and out exactly the same way, resulting in the same sequence of 
print messages.  The only difference in the two files should be the two lines printing
the *real* execution time, since that will vary from one run to another.

Explanation for different output for test_prio
The 3 process got spawn was 30, 29 and 28 which was 1 higher than the expected output because we have not implemented the idle process

The output sequence match up with expected output in term of priority level (Process of lower priority won't get to run unless higher priority are complete) but the sequence of process running on the same priority queue are not the same, this is probably because of the way we reinsert pcb back in the run queues after we decay all the estcpu value and recompute priority
